# PRVim
PRVim - Programming-Ready Vim, like an IDE.<br>
Created by Olafcio (Discord: OlafcioooX#0199)
## What's it?
PRVim is an Vim config, but when you run Vim using this config, it will be just... an very nice IDE.
## How to setup?
You can download .vimrc and copy it to your home directory, or install it in virtual environment (look below), or download setup.sh file to setup it.
## I want to test it... launch in virtual environment!
1. What's virtual environment?<br>
Virtual environment is not a virtual machine, but it's Bash with config that changes home directory, username and hostname (only for this virtual environment) to test programs without overriding your home files.<br>
2. How to make it?<br>
Just change HOME, USER and HOSTNAME variables, and boom! Programs think you are another user, you have another home directory and your computer have another hostname.<br>
3. Setupping it?<br>
Just download setup.sh file, and say that you want PRVim in virtual environment. Then type path of directory that you want to make that your home directory in your virtual environment be there. And working!
